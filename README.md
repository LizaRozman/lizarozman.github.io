Welcome to the repository containing the project we worked on during the practical 'Programming in the Life Sciences' at Maastricht University!

The aim of this project was to explore and visualize how similar mental disorders are to each other. While it is necssary to divide mental disorders into different categories and sub-categories for diagnostic reasons, this approach presents mental disorders in a binary way, and fails to show the inherently continous nature of these disorders. In reality, a person can show a range of symptoms that can be associated with multiple disroders, while the disorders themselves can arise from multiple underlying biological mechanisms, which also can overlap between disorders. We believe that studying such disorders in an integrated way without the necessity of focusing on one disroder or another may help us better identify the connections between symptoms and biological mechanisms.

To aid such research initiatives, we have created a website that eplores and visualizes potential overlaps between the symptoms, treatmetns, genetic associations and brain regions involved in different mental disorders. At the moment, were entirely relying on the quite limited data acquired from Wikidata to do so, however our code may be modified to use other sources as well. This would making the comparison more accurate, and also aaplicable to a larger range of mental disorders.

How to use:
1.Navigate to Welcome page of our project by clicking the link in the 'About' section on Github, or type "lizarozman.github.io" into your browser.
2.Once on the webpage, you can navigate between the 'Main', 'Overlap' and 'About us' pages via the navigation bar on top.

- The Main page contains a post about brain anatomy.
1. Click 'Read more' to see two interactive images of the brain (one lateral, and one lateral sliced view).
2. By hovering your mouse over different parts of the brain, a tooltip will show you the name of the region you are hovering over.
3. Click on a region you are interested in to go to the corresponding Wikipedia page with more information about the region.

- The Overlap page contains the main part of our project.
 1. Scroll down on this page to see 3 drop-down menus and a 'Searrch' button.
 2. Select the two different(!) mental disorders that you want to compare via the first two drop-down menus.
 3. Then, select which characteristic of the diseases you want to compare via the third drop-down menu.   
 4. Finaly, click 'Search' to see a Venn-diagram showing the characteristics of interest for both dsiorders, as well as the overlap between them (if there is any).
