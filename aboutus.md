We are a group of students from the Maastricht Science Programme (Maastricht University) and we built this website as a project for a course (PRA3006 Programming in the Life Sciences. We are Inga, Sabi, Liza and Sonia, and the purpose of our project was to visualize the overlaps between different qualities of different neurological diseases. These diseases are complex and heterogeneous, so we thought that by using databases such as Wikidata, we could make an easily acessible placein which you can compare any two diseases together.

We hope you enjoy our project!
